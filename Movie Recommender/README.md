#                                                              - by Aditya Gupta




                               
A web application that suggests movies to users based on their preferences 
A smart and interactive movie recommendation system built using **Python**, **Flask**, **HTML/CSS**, and **TMDb API**.  
Just enter a movie name and instantly get suggestions with posters, descriptions, and release dates.






🚀 About The Project



In a world with an overwhelming number of movie choices, this Movie Recommender system helps users discover films they are likely to enjoy. The application leverages a content-based filtering algorithm to analyze movie features and suggest similar titles. The goal is to provide a simple, intuitive, and effective way for users to find their next favorite movie.







✨ Features



•Personalized Recommendations: Get movie suggestions based on a movie you like.

•Content-Based Filtering: The recommendation engine analyzes movie genres, keywords, cast, and crew to find similar movies.

•Interactive UI: A clean and user-friendly interface built to provide a seamless user experience.

•Detailed Movie Information: Displays movie posters, overviews, and other relevant details for each recommendation.





🧠 What I Learned



•This project was a fantastic learning experience. Here are some of the key skills and concepts I developed:

•Machine Learning: Gained hands-on experience with content-based filtering and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like TF-IDF vectorization.

•Web Development: Enhanced my skills in front-end and back-end development, connecting a machine learning model to a user-facing web application.

•API Integration: Learned how to fetch data from external APIs (like TMDB) to enrich the application with movie details and posters.

•Data Science: Practiced data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering on a real-world dataset.

•Project Management: Managed the project from ideation and data collection to deployment.
